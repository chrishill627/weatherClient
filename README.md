WRITE IN PROPER MARKDOWN!!

I would have chose a different api as it was hard to work with!

Methods like getting the count down to sunset would have been made much easier with an date object than a string.

Sortin gout the sunset time ended horrible, I usually like to use times which can be displayed and worked with using moment js as I find working with dates in javascript always gets a little ugly.
