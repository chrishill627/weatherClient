Use: open index.html and check the weather in Leeds.

Resources:

Underscore js to help me build a much nicer object to work with as the object returned from the api had the keys very nested.
Moment for formatting dates.
The grid system from bootstrap for the responsive front end.
Sass.
Grunt.
Grunt watch.
Bower.

What I would change:

I would have chose a different api as it was hard to work with!

Methods like getting the count down to sunset would have been made much easier with an date object than a string.

Sorting out the sunset time ended horrible, I usually like to use times which can be displayed and worked with using moment js as I find working with dates in javascript always gets a little ugly.

I would use angular.js to avoid making the api calls on each button click and just loop through the object index.
